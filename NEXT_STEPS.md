## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Potential Challenges:

1. **Data Access Delays**
   - **Mitigation**: Apply early, have backup datasets identified
   - **Alternative**: Use summary statistics for initial analyses

2. **Limited Sample Sizes**
   - **Mitigation**: Meta-analysis across multiple cohorts
   - **Alternative**: Focus on effect size rather than just significance

3. **Null Findings**
   - **Mitigation**: Frame as important negative results
   - **Alternative**: Emphasize methodological contributions

4. **Technical Challenges**
   - **Mitigation**: Build in buffer time for troubleshooting
   - **Alternative**: Seek expert consultation early
