## Option 1: Complete GitHub CLI Authentication (Quickest)

A GitHub authentication process was started. To complete it:

1. **Copy this one-time code**: `B66B-EB90`

2. **Visit**: https://github.com/login/device

3. **Paste the code** and authorize the application

4. **Then run**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/ubuntu/github_repos/Abacus-VitD-DM2
   git push -u origin master
   ```

## Option 2: Use Personal Access Token (Most Reliable)

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name: `Abacus-VitD-DM2-Upload`
4. Select scopes: **`repo`** (full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again)

### Step 2: Push Using Token

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/github_repos/Abacus-VitD-DM2

# Replace YOUR_TOKEN_HERE with your actual token
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN_HERE@github.com/ej777spirit/Abacus-VitD-DM2.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin master
```

## Option 3: Use SSH Key (For Future Convenience)

### Generate SSH Key:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
# Press Enter to accept default location
# Optionally set a passphrase
```

### Add SSH Key to GitHub:
```bash
# Copy the public key
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/keys
2. Click "New SSH key"
3. Paste your public key
4. Click "Add SSH key"

### Update Remote and Push:
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/github_repos/Abacus-VitD-DM2
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:ej777spirit/Abacus-VitD-DM2.git
git push -u origin master
```

---

## Option 4: Manual Upload via GitHub Web Interface

If you prefer not to use command line:

1. Go to: https://github.com/ej777spirit/Abacus-VitD-DM2
2. Click "uploading an existing file" or "Add file" → "Upload files"
3. Drag and drop the entire `/home/ubuntu/github_repos/Abacus-VitD-DM2` folder contents
4. Commit the changes

**Note**: This method doesn't preserve git history.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Repository not found"
- Ensure the repository exists at https://github.com/ej777spirit/Abacus-VitD-DM2
- Check if it's a private repo and you have access

### Error: "Authentication failed"
- Try Option 2 (Personal Access Token)
- Ensure your token has `repo` scope

### Error: "Permission denied"
- Verify you're the repository owner or have write access
- Check SSH key is added to GitHub (if using SSH)
