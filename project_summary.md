## Impact Statement

This research addresses a critical gap in our understanding of Type 2 Diabetes mechanisms in African ancestry populations. By employing a comprehensive multi-omics approach, we will:

1. **Advance scientific knowledge** of vitamin D-T2D mechanisms and resolve the vitamin D paradox
2. **Identify novel biomarkers** for personalized vitamin D supplementation
3. **Discover therapeutic targets** for drug development
4. **Reduce health disparities** through population-specific research
5. **Enable precision medicine** for T2D prevention and management

Even modest improvements in T2D prevention (10-20% risk reduction) in this high-risk population could prevent hundreds of thousands of cases and save billions in healthcare costs.
