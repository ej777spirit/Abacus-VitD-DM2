## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) disproportionately affects individuals of African ancestry, with prevalence rates 60-100% higher than European populations. Paradoxically, African ancestry populations exhibit lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels yet demonstrate reduced skeletal fragility, suggesting population-specific vitamin D metabolism and signaling. This research proposes a hierarchical multi-omics investigation to elucidate the genetic, proteomic, and metabolomic mechanisms underlying vitamin D's role in T2D pathogenesis specifically in African ancestry males.

## RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS

**Primary Hypothesis:**  
Genetic variants in vitamin D metabolism and signaling pathways exhibit ancestry-specific effects on T2D risk in African ancestry males, mediated through distinct proteomic and metabolomic signatures that differ from European ancestry populations.

**Sub-Hypotheses:**

1. **Genomic Level:** Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in *VDR*, *CYP2R1*, *CYP27B1*, *GC*, and *CYP24A1* genes demonstrate population-specific allele frequencies and effect sizes on T2D risk in African ancestry males.

2. **Proteomic Level:** Vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) isoforms and vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression patterns differ between African ancestry males with and without T2D, independent of serum 25(OH)D levels.

3. **Metabolomic Level:** Vitamin D supplementation induces distinct metabolic signatures in glucose metabolism, insulin signaling, and inflammatory pathways in African ancestry males compared to other populations.

4. **Integrative Hypothesis:** Ancestry-specific genetic variants modulate proteomic responses to vitamin D, which in turn regulate metabolomic pathways critical for glucose homeostasis and T2D pathogenesis.

## SPECIFIC AIMS

### **AIM 1: Identify Ancestry-Specific Genetic Variants in Vitamin D Pathways Associated with T2D Risk**

**Rationale:**  
Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous T2D risk loci, but most discoveries derive from European ancestry populations. African ancestry populations possess greater genetic diversity and distinct linkage disequilibrium patterns, potentially harboring unique causal variants. The *GC* gene (encoding VDBP) exhibits the Gc1f allele at ~80% frequency in African populations versus ~1% in Europeans, fundamentally altering vitamin D bioavailability.

**Approach:**

1. **Dataset Integration:**
   - Primary: ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) - African American cohort (n=4,266)
   - Secondary: Jackson Heart Study genomic data (n=3,000+)
   - Validation: UK Biobank African ancestry subset (n=8,000+)
   - GWAS Catalog mining for known vitamin D and T2D loci

2. **Genetic Analysis Pipeline:**
   - **Quality Control:** Standard GWAS QC (MAF >0.01, HWE p>1×10⁻⁶, genotyping rate >95%)
   - **Imputation:** TOPMed reference panel (optimized for African ancestry)
   - **Association Testing:** 
     - Logistic regression (T2D case-control)
     - Linear regression (HbA1c, fasting glucose as quantitative traits)
     - Covariates: age, BMI, geographic ancestry PCs (1-10)
   - **Candidate Gene Analysis:** Deep sequencing of *VDR*, *CYP2R1*, *CYP27B1*, *GC*, *CYP24A1*
   - **Gene-based Tests:** SKAT-O for rare variant burden
   - **Polygenic Risk Scores:** Ancestry-specific PRS construction and validation

3. **Functional Annotation:**
   - eQTL analysis using GTEx (pancreas, adipose, muscle, liver tissues)
   - Chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) in relevant cell types
   - Transcription factor binding site disruption analysis
   - 3D genome interaction mapping (Hi-C data)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Identification of 5-10 genome-wide significant loci (p<5×10⁻⁸)
- Discovery of African ancestry-specific variants not captured in European GWAS
- Functional characterization of causal variants affecting gene expression
- Ancestry-specific polygenic risk score with improved prediction accuracy

**Statistical Power:**  
With n=4,266 (ARIC) at 30% T2D prevalence, 80% power to detect OR=1.3 at MAF=0.10 (α=5×10⁻⁸).

### **AIM 2: Characterize Proteomic Signatures of Vitamin D Signaling in T2D Among African Ancestry Males**

**Rationale:**  
Serum 25(OH)D levels poorly predict vitamin D bioactivity in African ancestry populations due to VDBP polymorphisms affecting binding affinity. The "free hormone hypothesis" suggests bioavailable (non-VDBP-bound) vitamin D better reflects physiological activity. Proteomic profiling can reveal vitamin D-responsive proteins and pathways independent of total 25(OH)D measurements.

**Approach:**

1. **Dataset Utilization:**
   - Primary: PRIDE Archive PXD015234 (African American T2D proteomics, n=200)
   - Secondary: Human Protein Atlas - pancreatic tissue expression
   - Validation: Generate new data if needed using publicly available biobanks

2. **Proteomic Analysis Strategy:**

   **A. Discovery Phase - Untargeted Proteomics:**
   - LC-MS/MS analysis of plasma samples
   - Groups: T2D cases (n=100) vs. controls (n=100), stratified by vitamin D status
   - Quantification: TMT-based isobaric labeling
   - Coverage: >5,000 proteins, depth >3 peptides/protein
   - Statistical analysis: Limma with FDR<0.05

   **B. Targeted Validation - Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM):**
   - Focus on vitamin D pathway proteins:
     - VDBP (GC) and isoforms (Gc1f, Gc1s, Gc2)
     - VDR and co-regulators (RXR, SRC family)
     - CYP enzymes (CYP2R1, CYP27B1, CYP24A1)
     - Downstream targets: insulin signaling (IRS1, IRS2, AKT), inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6, TNF-α)

   **C. Functional Proteomics:**
   - Phosphoproteomics to assess insulin signaling activation
   - Protein-protein interaction networks (STRING, BioGRID)
   - Pathway enrichment analysis (KEGG, Reactome, GO)

3. **Integration with Genomics:**
   - pQTL (protein quantitative trait loci) mapping
   - Mendelian randomization to infer causality
   - Correlation of genetic variants with protein abundance

4. **Bioavailable Vitamin D Calculation:**
   - Measure total 25(OH)D, VDBP, albumin
   - Calculate free and bioavailable 25(OH)D using validated equations
   - Correlate with proteomic signatures

**Expected Outcomes:**
- Identification of 50-100 differentially expressed proteins between T2D cases and controls
- Characterization of VDBP isoform distribution and functional consequences
- Discovery of novel vitamin D-responsive proteins in glucose metabolism
- Validation of bioavailable vitamin D as superior predictor of proteomic changes

**Innovation:**  
First comprehensive proteomic characterization of vitamin D signaling specifically in African ancestry males with T2D, addressing the "vitamin D paradox" at the molecular level.

## CONCLUSION

This research addresses a critical gap in our understanding of vitamin D's role in Type 2 diabetes, specifically in African ancestry males—a population disproportionately affected by T2D yet underrepresented in biomedical research. By integrating genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, we will elucidate ancestry-specific mechanisms and identify biomarkers for personalized vitamin D supplementation strategies.

The hierarchical multi-omics approach, starting with genetic discovery and progressing through proteomic and metabolomic characterization, provides a comprehensive framework for understanding complex gene-environment interactions. The use of publicly available datasets ensures feasibility and cost-effectiveness, while the computational focus enables rapid progress and reproducibility.

Successful completion of this research will:
1. Advance scientific knowledge of vitamin D-T2D mechanisms
2. Identify novel therapeutic targets and biomarkers
3. Inform clinical guidelines for vitamin D supplementation
4. Contribute to reducing health disparities
5. Establish a framework for multi-omics investigation of other complex diseases

This work represents a significant step toward precision medicine for T2D prevention and management in African ancestry populations, with potential to improve health outcomes for millions of individuals.
